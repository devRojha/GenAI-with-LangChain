And have a very characteristic song, Imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together At the end of their lives they're going around each other, crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second. As they do so, they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space an actual wave on space-time. Space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe. Those are the gravitational waves and are literally the sounds of space ringing and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coalesce into one, spinning, quiet, black hole. If you were standing near enough, your ear would resonate with the squeezing and stretching of space, you would literally hear the sound. Imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole. The sound you're hearing is a light black hole banging on space each time it gets close. As it falls in, it gets faster, and it gets louder. Scientists used to think black holes were immortal, but even these will one day die. Now we're talking about time scales of unimaginable length quadrillions of years into the future. On that time scale, even the black holes begin to evaporate.

The latest evidence shows that the universe is not slowing down, but it's speeding up out of control. And the universe, we think, will die in ice trillions upon trillions of years from now. Empty space itself has energy. In every little cubic centimeter of space, whether or not there's stuff, whether or not there's particles, matter, radiation, whatever... there is still energy, even in the space itself. And this energy, according to Einstein, exerts a push on the universe. What is the weird stuff that's accelerating the universe? We call it 'Dark energy'. And this stuff is the dominant stuff of the universe almost 3/4 of the matter-energy content of the universe is this dark energy and we don't know what it is. Dark energy, unlike matter or radiation, does not dilute away, as the universe expands. This has crucial implications for what the universe is going to do in the future. So, what will be the future of the universe? Well, if the dark energy remains dominant and repulsive, the universe will expand forever. Faster and faster and faster with time - A runaway universe. 70% of the energy of the universe resides in empty space and we don't understand why. But we do know what will happen. If that energy continues to be there, the universe will become cold and dark and empty. That's the future as it might be. We don't know because we don't yet understand the nature of dark energy. until we do, we won't know the future, we won't even understand our own origins and that's why we want to know and study this subject. \"Discovering the true nature of dark energy could change our vision of the future dramatically.\" \"If it somehow weakens over time, the universe could collapse under gravity - a 'big crunch'.\" \"Given a boost, it could tear the universe apart at the seams - a 'big rip'.\" [Black hole era]\n",

Others could collapse or be ripped apart.\" \"Others sill could be far more exotic than anything we could imagine.\" \"New pieces to this puzzle are out there somewhere, waiting to be found.\" The forecast does seem to be for an ever-colder, ever-emptier universe. But then of course we have to ask, \"Could that end lead to a new beginning?\" And there are ideas, whereby what actually is the end of our universe, could in some sense, lead to the beginning of a new one. \"Some speculate that there may be a way to escape our universe before entropy erases everything.\" \"We could create simulated virtual universes, or with enough energy, create another one just like our own.\" We've worked out the mathematics, the equations, they seem to say that if you have an atom smasher, that can constrict tremendous amounts of energy at a single point, you can perhaps open up a gateway - A 'Baby universe' Facing the death of everything there is this perhaps is their only possibility of escape. And this also raises a very intriguing possibility, sheer pure speculation of course, that perhaps any universe that has intelligent life in it, will create baby universes, will create 'Lifeboats', and will proliferate child universes. and will proliferate child universes.\n",
